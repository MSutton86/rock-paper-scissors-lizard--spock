# (5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 10 commits with descriptive messages.
# (15 points): As a developer, I want to find a way to properly incorporate inheritance into my game.
# (5 points): As a developer, I want to account for and handle bad user input, ensuring that any user input is validated and reobtained if necessary.
# (10 points): As a developer, I want to store all of the gesture options/choices in a List (AS STRINGS). I want to find a way to utilize the list of gestures within my code (display gesture options, assign player a gesture, etc).
# NOTE: Do not use a Gesture class until you have reached MVP for all user stories and been checked off by an instructor!
# (10 points): As a player, I want the correct player to win a given round based on the choices made by each player.  See below for game rules!
# (10 points): As a player, I want the game of RPSLS to be at minimum a “best of three” to decide a winner. 
# (10 points): As a player, I want the option of a single player (human vs AI) or a multiplayer (human vs human) game.
# Run through the Setup Setups and get your project ready to begin work.
# Review the Resources outlined below - be sure to have relevant documentation and references open while you develop!
# Start creating classes. Start thinking through what every class “has” and “does” based on the user stories and instructor discussion.
# Before you begin coding, write an algorithm that represents the steps necessary to play a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock in a best-of-three format. By writing out the steps, it will make you think about every piece needed to bring the game to life. Please submit to your instructor Slack channel once completed for approval to start coding. Below is an example of how to get started: 
# Step 1: Display the rules of the game 
# Step 2: Ask how many human players will be playing 

# The Big Bang Theory - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
#       * Explanation of game rules
# Rock crushes Scissors
# Scissors cuts Paper 
# Paper covers Rock
# Rock crushes Lizard
# Lizard poisons Spock
# Spock smashes Scissors
# Scissors decapitates Lizard
# Lizard eats Paper
# Paper disproves Spock
# Spock vaporizes Rock
# End Result  (Example Below)
